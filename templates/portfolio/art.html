<h2>Art</h2>

<p>These are projects of mine that I consider art.  They serve no purpose other than as a creative outlet; I simply wanted to create something beautiful to share with others.</p>

<ul class="projects-list">
  {% for project in object_list %}
  {% if project.status == 2 and project.project_type == project.ART_CAT %}
  
  {% include "portfolio/project_summary.html" %}
  
  {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
